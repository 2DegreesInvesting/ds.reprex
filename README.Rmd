A series of meetups about the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)
package.

## Syllabus

The goal is to lean how to use the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)
package for effective and pleasant conversations about R code.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

* Prepare a reprex for different venues (e.g. GitHub and slack).
* Understand what makes a reprex good (do’s and don’ts).
* Create synthetic data with `dput()`, and with the tibble and datapasta
packages.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.docker/releases) that
preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during thee
meetup.
