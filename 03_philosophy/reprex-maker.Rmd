This is a reprex maker with features following the [reprex
philosophy](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html#package-philosophy):

* If the code is not self-contained, you get an error.
* It captures the output that you would normally see on your screen.
* It allows you to copy + paste + run the output.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  error = TRUE,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

The reprex starts here:

```{r}
mean(y)

(y <- 1:4)
mean(y)
```
