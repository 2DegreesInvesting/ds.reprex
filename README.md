A series of meetups about the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)
package.

## Syllabus

The goal is to lean how to use the
[reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package for effective and
pleasant conversations about R code.

At the end of this series you will be able to do things like these:

-   Prepare a reprex for different venues (e.g. GitHub and slack).
-   Understand what makes a reprex good (do’s and don’ts).
-   Create synthetic data with `dput()` and friends.

Each item in this syllabus corresponds to a meetup and a GitHub
[release](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/ds.docker/releases) that
preserves a snapshot of this repository exactly as it was shown during
thee meetup.

## Motivation and overview

This meetup motivates the use of reprex and covers a fast-paced overview
of its most useful features.

Objectives:

-   Understand why writing a good reprex is worth the effort.
-   Overview the most useful features of reprex.

## Do’s and don’ts

This meetup covers the article “[Reprex do’s and
don’ts](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html)”.

Objectives:

-   Learn how to make an excellent reproducible example.

## Next (tentative)

-   Package philosophy and design.
